% probability = bayesian_replay(RateMap, nSpks, start, stop)
%
% --- INPUTS ---
% RateMap: Matrix, rate map for all the cells across the space
%          (rows: cell ids / columns: spatial bins)
%
% Spks: column vector, number of spks ocurring during the event for each
%        unit in the RateMap. ** length(nSpks) == length(RateMap) **
%
% start: float, starting time stamp of the event (same unit as spikes)
%
%
% stop: float, ending time stamp of the event (same unit as spikes)
%
% --- OUTPUTS ---
% probability: row vector, probability of each spatial position of being
%              replayed in the event.
