# Dorsal-Ventral HPC Coordination

These codes have been developed to study dorsal-ventral hippocampal coordination at different levels (single units, assemblies, LFP).

In the "toolbox" folder, you'll find both general and specific functions.

In the main folder, various pipelines have been provided to perform the analysis.

The codebase is created using MATLAB, and comprehensive documentation, along with line-by-line descriptions, has been provided for each section of the code.

This project is a work in progress, so please feel free to contact me if you discover any bugs.
